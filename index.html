        <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself
            because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what
            kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your
            impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to
            experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to
            listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the
            music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in
            the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I
            like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like
            to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like
            metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I
            like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the
            nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.This is a brief introduction of myself. Do not expect too much,
            and keep your sense of humor.</p>
